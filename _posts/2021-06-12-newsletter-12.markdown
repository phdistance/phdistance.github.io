Happy [Global Running Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Running_Day), the flagship manufactured holiday in which we celebrate our sport. I hope that everyone is able to take a few minutes or hours, hit the streets or trails, and enjoy a run today. And if not today, tomorrow, or the next. It's okay to not run on Global Running Day, but I am a fan doing something that evokes gratitude for the running experiences I have had in my life over the previous eight years or so.

### Rylee's Run Postmortem

The past couple of weeks have gotten away from me a bit, but I wanted to share the positive personal experience I had as a virtual participant in [Rylee's Run 5K](https://results.raceroster.com/en-US/results/eyhqkbq9budw996w?sub_event_option=structured_86594). It might be strange, or even surprising, but I believe that I set a personal best for the race at 23:27.
